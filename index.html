        <h3>What does being a ninja mean?</h3>
        <p>A ninja (忍者, Japanese pronunciation: [ɲiꜜɲdʑa]) or shinobi (忍び, [ɕinobi]) was a covert agent or mercenary in
            feudal
            Japan. The functions of a ninja included reconnaissance, espionage, infiltration, deception, ambush,
            bodyguarding and
            their fighting skills in martial arts, including ninjutsu. Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare
            were
            deemed dishonorable and beneath the honor of the samurai. Though shinobi proper, as specially trained spies
            and
            mercenaries, appeared in the 15th century during the Sengoku period, antecedents may have existed as early
            as
            the
            12th century.
