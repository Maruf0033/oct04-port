        <h3>What does being a ninja mean?</h3>
        <p>A ninja (忍者, Japanese pronunciation: [ɲiꜜɲdʑa]) or shinobi (忍び, [ɕinobi]) was a covert agent or mercenary in
            feudal
            Japan. The functions of a ninja included reconnaissance, espionage, infiltration, deception, ambush,
            bodyguarding and
            their fighting skills in martial arts, including ninjutsu. Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare
            were
            deemed dishonorable and beneath the honor of the samurai. Though shinobi proper, as specially trained spies
            and
            mercenaries, appeared in the 15th century during the Sengoku period, antecedents may have existed as early
            as
            the
            12th century.

    <h2 class="head">“Looking for the meaning of life, one man can discover the order of the universe. To discover the
        truth, to achieve. A
        higher spiritual state that is the true meaning of ninja.”</h2>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Despite many popular folktales, historical accounts of the ninja are scarce. Historian Stephen Turnbull
            asserts that the
            ninja were mostly recruited from the lower class, and therefore little literary interest was taken in them.
            The
            social origin of the ninja is seen as the reason they agree to operate in secret, trading their service for
            money
            without honor and glory. The scarcity of historical accounts is also demonstrated in war epics such as The
            Tale of
            Hōgen (Hōgen Monogatari) and The Tale of the Heike (Heike Monogatari), which focus mainly on the
            aristocratic samurai,
            whose deeds were apparently more appealing to the audience.

            Historian Kiyoshi Watatani states that the ninja were trained to be particularly secretive about their
            actions and
            existence:

            So-called ninjutsu techniques, in short are the skills of shinobi-no-jutsu and shinobijutsu, which have the
            aims of
            ensuring that one's opponent does not know of one's existence, and for which there was special training.</p>
